# Who am I?

Well I am an OAuth2 application, that can play with restream.io Rest API (in the name of you)

So what do i do ?

* I can watch `Restream` and be informed everytime a new live is launched, and retreive all the livestreams URLS across social networks.

## Run locally

npm i
npm run watch

And now go to http://localhost:9099

## Generate me
