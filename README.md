# Who am I?

Well I am an OAuth2 application, that can play with restream.io Rest API (in the name of you)

So what do i do ?

* I can watch `Restream` and be informed everytime a new live is launched, and retrieve all the livestreams URLS across social networks.

## Run locally

* In watch mode, (any change):

```bash
npm i
npm run watch
```

And now go to http://localhost:9099

## Generate me
